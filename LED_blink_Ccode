The LED Blink Practice project is a fundamental embedded systems programming exercise that demonstrates the basic principles of microcontroller operation and GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) control. This project serves as an excellent starting point for beginners in embedded C programming and provides a foundation for more complex embedded systems projects.
